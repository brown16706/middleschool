          <p><b>Create Your Own Myth</b><br/>
            Myths were often used to explain natural phenomena. Your challenge is to create your
            own myth to explain some natural phenomenon or land formation. It could be anything from the origin
            of hurricanes to how the Grand Canyon. Tell this myth in a story
            format, similar to how D’Aulaire wrote his stories about Greek gods and goddesses.<br/>
            <br/>Here are the guidelines:<br/>
            1. Your story must involve at least two Olympian Gods or Goddesses. You may involve more than two if
            you like.<br/>
            2. Your story must explain some natural phenomenon (such as a weather event) or some geological
            feature (a mountain range, a large valley, a sea, an ocean, a polar ice cap, etc.). <br/>

            1. Why does April refuse the invitation to spend Christmas with her mother and Nick'?<br/>
            2. April's new home, the Casa Rosada, is referred to as "The Petrified Birthday Cake." What else in
            April's life might also be adequately defined using this metaphor? Why?<br/>
            3. Toward the end of the story the Professor is described as follows: "he looked pretty much as
            April remembered him and his voice was still gravelly and grave, but he seemed younger, somehow, and
            more lively." What does this reveal about the Professor and his experiences and feelings?<br/>
            4. What is meant by the comment that April "gave an internal nod of approval"? <br/>
            5. Explain what is meant by the comment that "When somebody saves your life, it makes him sort of

          <p>How does The Egypt Game connect to you?<br/>
            1. At one point in the story April, Elizabeth, Melanie, and Marshall become petrified with fear.
            Page 104 describes their feelings: "In all four Egyptians frozen fear boiled at once into a choking
            mixture of anger and relief." Describe a time when you were full of fear. What generated this fear,
            and how did you overcome it?<br/>
            2. When the questions for the oracle are returned with answers, nobody will claim responsibility for
            the answers. All the children accuse each other, but nobody will take the blame. Analyze this
            occurrence and relate it to a time in your life when someone you knew wouldn't admit responsibility
            for some action or outcome. What happened in the end?<br/>
            3. The Professor told the children that his late wife was an artist while he was an anthropologist.
            She defined anthropologists as "only interested in people in general while she liked people in
            particular and she did, too." Do you like people more in general or in particular? What qualities do
            you admire? What qualities disturb you? Think of your best friend. Why do you like him or her so
            much?<br/>
            4. In what directions does your imagination take you? Do you like elaborate games, or do you write
            stories, or do you explore imaginary worlds in some other way? Please explain.<br/>

          <p className="topBottom">After being homeschooled for most of her life, Stargirl enters the 10th grade with a
            big splash. At first everyone thinks she is amazing. She is different from anyone they've ever met. She has
            a pet rat, plays the ukelele, and doesn't conform to be like everyone else. Leo falls in love with her. Then
            everyone turns on Stargirl. Suddenly, everything that made her special now makes her an outcast. She knows
            that Leo sees himself as part of the group. He needs to fit in and needs her to fit in as well. So Stargirl
            changes her personality and her appearance to make him happy.</p>
          <p>In a 5 paragraph Persuasive essay, answer the following question:</p>
          <p>Should Stargirl have changed to try to fit it and become popular?</p>
          <p className="topBottom">Think about the question and form a clear opinion about it. Watch the video and read
            the outline below. Then write a persuasive essay that supports your opinion. Be sure to use examples from
            the book.</p>
          <Video videourl="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5uSJEiNZ1rE"/>
          <p>Your five paragraph essay should follow the format below: </p>
          <ul className="assnList">
            <li>Title</li>
            <li><strong>Introduction paragraph: </strong>Write a hook to grab your reader's attention. Your first
              paragraph should have a clear thesis statement (main idea of your essay). This
              statement should convey the points or arguments you are going to
              make. It is a road map for your essay and should answer the question, "What
              is this paper about?" The final sentence for this paragraph should smoothly transition to the next
              paragraph.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Body</strong> Paragraphs 2-4 should provide examples from the book that support your thesis
              statement. Each
              paragraph should discuss a different point and use different examples, explanations and support. Using
              direct
              quotes from the novel can be effective. Try to think of an argument someone might use against you and
              address this in a paragraph.
            </li>
            <li>Your <strong>conclusion </strong> should restate your thesis in a different way. End with a thoughtful
              summary.
            </li>
            <li>Each paragraph should be 3-5 sentences.</li>

          <h4> What makes a poem … a poem?</h4>
          <p>What exactly makes a poem … a poem? Poets themselves have struggled with this question, often using
            metaphors to approximate a definition. Is a poem a little machine? A firework? An echo? A dream? </p>
          <p> What makes a poem a poem is its ability to make the reader feel something. It may rhyme, but doesn’t have
            to. Using few words, it creates a picture in the reader's mind and transports them to another place and
            time. </p>

            it slowly.<br/>
            A good poet will have made every word in the poem count. <br/>Step into the poem
            and wander around. Take your time. <br/>
            See where the encounter takes you. <br/>
            You might not like the poem. It might do nothing for you. <br/>
            Don’t feel under any pressure to like every
            poem you meet. You won’t. <br/>
            Relax. Hmmm… the poem has got you intrigued? But you don’t understand it. <br/>
            Not to worry. Poems aren’t
            crossword puzzles. There’s no correct answer. <br/>
            A good poem will offer many paths to meander along.</p>

          <h4>How to Write a Poem</h4>
          <p>The following is from <i>Literacy at Work: How to Write a Poem with Glenis Redmond.</i></p>
          {/*<p>Taken from <i>Countdown to Poetry Writing</i> by Steve Bowkett</p>*/}
          <Video videoUrl="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0w8PLcYP0sU"/>
          <p> After you watch the video, complete the lists below. Then, use the lists to write
            your Self-Portrait Poem.</p>
          <h4>Write a list that describes your:</h4>
          <ol className="vocab">
            <li>Outer self - how you look (Example: Brown eyes, Mahogany skin, Tomboy, Graceful swagger, Pigtails)
            </li>
            <li>Inner self - feelings and emotions (Example: Joy, Shame, Focused, Popular, Lonely)</li>
            <li>Talents or strengths (Example: Athletic, Graceful, Reader)</li>
            <li>Challenges or things you find difficult (Being alone, Math, Racism)</li>
          </ol>
          <p className="topBottom"> Use your lists to help you tell your story. Remember to use the poetry
            devices of alliteration, assonance, and anaphora. It's best if you can create your own poem, but if you
            want, you can use the sentences below as a model.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>When I was in _____________________, I looked like _____________________.</li>
            <li>I liked to play _____________________ with _____________________.</li>
            <li>I was happy to _____________________ but felt scared when _____________________.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="topBottom">This example is from the poet from the poet Glenis Redmond </p>
